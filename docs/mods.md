# Moderators

Moderators on the server have the **MOD** role. They can run some additional commands.

- [Alias](mod/alias.md)
- [Cleanup Messages](mod/cleanup.md)
- [Custom Commands](mod/custom-com.md)


## Official Red Docs

There are not that many custom written mod-only commands on the RACF server. As such, you can additionally consult the [Red Docs: Commands](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_commands/) for moderator-specific documenation.
