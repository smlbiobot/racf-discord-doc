## Two-Factor Authentication

If you wish to use the GUI to manage members, you will need to setup Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for your Discord account. [Check out the Discord support documentation](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication) to get started.
