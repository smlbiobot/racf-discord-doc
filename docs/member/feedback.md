# Feedback

If you have any suggestions for the RoyaleAPI or would like to complain about something, you can use the `!feedback` command and send a message to us. The messages will be read by MODs and Leaders (but not Co-Leaders) on the server.

You can either do this in **#bot-commands** or DM AlphaBot directly and type that in the DM.

## Example

`!feedback Someone is using abusive language in clan. Can you help me out?`
