## Rules + Roles

`!racf` displays links to the RoyaleAPI rules, roles, and discord invite link.

<!--
## Farmers

`!farmers` fetches the Farmers data and display in the Discord chat as a table. A newer version will store data as JSON on the server, but this is a work-around in the meanwhile.

Command | Functionality
`!farmers` | Show the latest farmers.
`!farmers 2| Show the farmers on Week 2 since we started recording data. -->
