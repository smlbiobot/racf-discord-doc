A number of bot commands were written specifically for the RACF Discord server.

# Change clan (!changeclan)

Used when you change from one RACF clan to another. Syntax:

`!changeclan Alpha`

`!changeclan Delta`

The *eSports* role require leader approval and as such is not supported by this command. If you got accepted into Alpha eSports, please contact one of the leaders (Slayer / Xhadian / SaintBelekin) to update your roles.

# Toggle role (!togglerole)

A number of roles are self-assignable / self-removable by members. Syntax:

`!togglerole Heist`

`!togglerole Practice`

* **Heist. **Used to play the game !heist in #casino. Mentionable. (Default: disabled)
* **Practice. **Used for weekly practice. Self-assign in order to see the #practice channel as well as notifications and info for practice sessions. (Default: enabled)
* **Tourney.** Used for tournament notification. Self-assign in order to get notifications for tournaments. Mention the role to alert others with tournament information, e.g. `@Tourney Name: Awesome Tournament / Password: AwesomePass / 10k gem 1000-player x2000 cards` (Default: enabled)
* **Recruit.** Self-assign to see recruiting information about Alpha eSports. (Default: disabled)





# Rules + Roles (!racf)

This displays links to the RACF rules, roles, and discord invite link.

# Farmers (!farmers)

This fetches the Farmers data from Nuclino and display in the Discord chat as a table. A newer version will store data as JSON on the server, but this is a work-around in the meanwhile.

Type `!farmers` to show the latest farmers.

Type `!farmers 2` to show the farmers on Week 2 since we started recording data.
