# Channels

Discord servers are broken down into channels with different topics. As a member, you are able to see the following channels:

- **#welcome.** This channel is read-only for all except co-leaders and leaders. It is used to greet visitors and used for role assignments only.
- **#visitors.** This is the public chat for everyone.
- **#family-chat.** This is the members-only chat. Everyone from the clan family chats here. There are no clan-specific chats on our server.
- **#strategy.** Need help with a deck? Have pro-tips to share? This channel is for you. Trolling on this channel is strictly prohibited. Please try to be helpful in offering advice.
- **#rant.** Rant your hearts out
- **#discordgram.** Instagram on Discord. You can only post photos here. You will need to run bot commands to add a comment to the photo. See [Discordgram](member/discordgram.md) for more info.
- **#bot-comamnds.** This is where you should run most of the bot commands. In fact, many of the commands mentioned in this guide are disabled in the chat channels to prevent spam. Please note that while this channel is for bot commands, casino commands are banned here. You need to use the **#casino** channel to run casino commands as they are quite spammy.
- **#casino.** This is where you gamble with Discord credits. See [Casino](member/casino.md) for more info.
