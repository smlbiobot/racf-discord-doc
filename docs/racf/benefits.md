# Benefits of joining 100T


𝟭. Be a part of a clan family that’s very successful on the global ladder.  Our **top 3 clans** (Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie) are all in the **Global Top 200** with Alpha finishing top 20 each season and Bravo top 100.

𝟮. We have a **very active Discord server** that you will share with 400+ members of 100T — most of which are better than you & me will ever be, so you can take advantage of:

- Tips from **#strategy** channel.
- See 12-win GC decks that our members have used in **#decks** channel (so we at least have a chance).
- Use **#bot-commands** to search top decks.  

Of those three items, you can only take advantage of the 3rd on (#bot-commands) as a visitor to our family.

𝟯. **The people in 100T are F\*\*\*ING AWESOME!**

- Get to know them in **#family-chat** and **#discordgram**
- Dive into certain topics you’re interested in like our **#food** where we share recipes, etc.
- Rant your hearts out in **#rant**

𝟰. **Being around other people that are pushing themselves to be better at this game makes you better at the game**. As you get better, you would want to push to Golf, Foxtrot, Echo, Delta, etc. — it’s a form of progressive advancement that Clash Royale doesn't have through achievements.

- Bonus: if you are active here and you are a decent person to hang around, plenty of people will jump in and help you out!

𝟱. You get access to our **#tournaments channel** where we share passwords to tournaments. From there, take part in trying out for our competitive teams, cheer on the friends you made in #family-chat, and watch Woody hit some news, brews, and queues with us from time to time at http://twitch.tv/woody !
