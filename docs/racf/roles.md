# Roles

This gives a summary of what is expected from members with different roles in the RACF.

## Members

* Members are encouraged to advance once they hit the trophy minimum of the next clan up, and required to do so in excess of \~200 trophies.
* Leaders should send members a DM / clan message advising them to move up to the parent clan if the memberâ€™s trophies are too high. Members can be kicked after 72 hrs if they did not move up by themselves.

## Elders

* Accept new members.
* When accepting new members, they should:
  * Ask if the person is new to the RACF.
  * Ask that person to join our Discord server: [http://discord.gg/racf](http://discord.gg/racf)
  * Let them know about the 50/50 kicking policy.
* Not allowed to kick 50/50.

## Co-Leaders

* All the duties of elders.
* Kick the 50/50 as soon as it happens (except during [Grace Period](https://app.nuclino.com/t/b/b0aae9db-c454-471a-92b1-2a7d37e86be3)).
  * When kicking members, DM that member on Discord and advise them to join the feeder clans.
  * Edit and update roles on Discord after accepting + kicking.
* Must be active on Discord.
* Assign roles to people on Discord.
* Not required to move up for high trophies, but can be kicked as 50/50.

## Leaders

* All the duties of co-leaders.
* Cannot be kicked as 50/50. If clan is full, 49/50 should be kicked.
* Should try to push trophies to avoid being at the bottom.
* Everything else.
