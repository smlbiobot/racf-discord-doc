# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the Reddit Alpha Clan Family (RACF)?

The **Reddit Alpha Clan Family (RACF)** was established by Woody shortly after the Clash Royale soft launch. From humble beginnings, Reddit Alpha has grown into a Global Top 15 clan with hundreds of members throughout a thriving system of nine family clans in Clash Royale and four family bands in Brawl Stars.

Our clan family is home to many of Clash Royale's greatest tournament players, three of whom made it to the Crown Duel. We have 3 clans on the global leaderboard with Reddit Alpha consistently in the top 15, Reddit Bravo consistently in the top 100 and Reddit Charlie consistently in the top 200. Every clan in our family finishes the clan crown chest early every time.

In Brawl Stars, the RACF has 3 trophy-pushing bands and 1 CR-members-only band. Since the first day of app’s beta launch, the RACF has had a presence on the global leaderboard, with Reddit Alpha being consistently on the top 10 and Reddit Bravo in the top 50.

## Which are your CR clans and BR bands?

We name our clans according to the NATO alphabet. At the moment, our clans / bands are:

## How do I join your clans/bands?

If you are interested in our trophy-pushing clans, just request in-app if you meet that clan’s trophy requirements. If you are interested in joining our eSports clan, please check out the
[Alpha eSports FAQ](racf/esports-faq.md) to see how you might apply. You can also speak to us on our Discord server at http://discord.gg/racf

## What does trophy-pushing mean?

Members in our trophy-pushing clans strive to be the best players in the game. They are constantly battling to increase their rank and trophies. To stay competitive, we kick the last person on each clan’s roster to the feeders. People from the feeders can move up to clans with higher trophy requirements when they meet them.

## Why does the trophy requirement keep on going up?

The trophy requirements of our trophy-pushing clans are set to the #15-20 of the clan. This ensures that you have room to drop in trophies (aka tilt) without the constant pressure of being kicked. As each season progresses, so does members’ trophies, so the trophy requirements go up as time passes. Further, being in the clan family helps players grow and your card levels may also increase over time. All these will result in higher trophies.

## I no longer meet the trophy requirements of the clan. Will you kick me?

Unless you are 50/50 (last) in the clan, you will not be kicked. The trophy requirements of the clan applies to those who are looking to join, and is not a requirement for members to meet in order to stay. If you feel that you may tilt to the last place of the clan though, you are welcome to join the next feeder to relieve the constant pressure.

## I have tilted. Will you give me 12 hours to push back up so I won’t be kicked?

We kick 50/50 as soon as it happens. We do not give special exceptions to members because that would be unfair to others. In fact, the only people that we do not kick are Leaders. Co-Leaders get kicked if they are at the bottom as well.

**Note:** Since Brawl Stars is a new game, Co-Leaders and Elders are also exempt from being kicked. This is to ensure that there are enough people to accept join requests as well as performing the 50/50 kicks.

## Why did I get kicked from the clan? I was not last.

We kick the last person in the clan unless that member is the Leader (Clash Royale clans), or Elders / Co-Leaders / Leader (Brawl Stars). If your trophies appear to be higher than the last non-kick-exempt member, it is possible that the second last person tilted more than you did between the time of kicking and when you checked the app.

## How do you become an elder?

If you are mature and active in the clan and Discord, we will promote you as an elder after you have been with us for a little while.  Unlike many other CR clans, we do not use donation quota nor crown contribution as a deciding factor when making these decisions. There is currently no set timeframe for when one can become an elder. The decision is completely up to the leader / co-leaders of the clan.

## How do you become a co-leader?

We try to maintain 2-4 co-leaders in each clan. When we require more co-leaders in the clan, the leader will look at all the elders from the entire family and make selections. These will often be discussed among all the leaders before one is officially appointed. As with elders, we do not promote based on trophy levels / competitive performance. Maturity is the primary deciding factor.

## What is your BM (bad manners) policy?

The RACF does not have any policy against BM'ing random people you meet in ladder, challenges or tourneys. We do ask that our members not BM each other unless it’s agreed upon beforehand in some way, though. We understand that there is a mute button but feel that there should be a basic level of respect among fellow RACF members. We also encourage anyone who is offended by emotes to make use of the in-game mute button. BM'ing in clan chat (i.e. being a dick to your clan mates) is a kickable offense. If any RACF member is found to be consistently BM'ing other RACF members then they may be subject to punishment of some sort.

## What is a high elder?

We grant a special role called *High Elder* on our Discord server. The role is an acknowledgement of member contribution approaching that provided by those in leadership, despite there being no in-game need for an actual promotion to Co-Leader. High Elders are granted access to the same discussion rooms as those in leadership, and are strong candidates for Co-Leader, but do not receive that role in-game until the Leader requires additional support. See also [Roles](/racf/roles.md) for each role’s responsibilities.

## How can I be part of the competitive team?

We usually make an announcement on Discord whenever we are assembling teams to represent RACF in upcoming tournaments. If there is a try-out,  you should obviously play in one so the team captains can evaluate your game plays. In others, we allow team captains to select their players. If you are new to the family and feel that you are not known among the captains, you can demonstrate your skills by finishing in top spots in 10k tournaments and/or get into the championship rounds for the RACF Tourney, which is held bi-monthly.

## Brawl Stars

### Why are the leaders at the bottom of the roster?

As a well-established clan family in Clash Royale, the Reddit Alpha Clan Family (RACF) is primarily interested in building a top global clan (aka band) in Brawl Stars. To ensure the long-term success of such clan, we feel that strong leadership is required, and we have initiated our effort by placing our best players in CR to form the leadership for Reddit Alpha.

We recognize that CR skills do not necessarily translate to BS skills, and that some of you are concerned that our leadership is currently at the bottom of the roster. In order to ensure the future success of the clan family though, we do feel that having trustworthy co-leaders is a must.

The game is simply too new right now to consider promotions, but it is something that we will definitely be doing in the future. Thank you very much for your patience.

### Can I join Reddit Delta (BS) if I get kicked from Charlie?

You must be a member in our Clash Royale clans to join Reddit Delta in Brawl Stars. No exceptions.

### Where can I download Brawl Stars on Android?

Brawl Stars has not been released on Android.
