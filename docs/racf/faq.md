# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the 100T Clan Family (100T)?

**100T Alpha** is the official clan of **100 Thieves**, an esports team competing in Clash Royale League. The eight clans below comprise the **100 Thieves Clan Family**, which is home to many experienced trophy-pushing and tournament competitors. The clans were created as a result of a merger and re-branding of the Reddit Alpha Clan Family, founded by Woody in January 2016.

## Which are your CR clans and BR bands?

We name our clans according to the NATO alphabet. At the moment, our clans / bands are:

## How do I join your clans/bands?

Please apply on our Discord https://discord.gg/100t

## How do you become an elder?

If you are mature and active in the clan and Discord, we will promote you as an elder after you have been with us for a little while.  Unlike many other CR clans, we do not use donation quota nor crown contribution as a deciding factor when making these decisions. There is currently no set timeframe for when one can become an elder. The decision is completely up to the leader / co-leaders of the clan.

## How do you become a co-leader?

We try to maintain 2-4 co-leaders in each clan. When we require more co-leaders in the clan, the leader will look at all the elders from the entire family and make selections. These will often be discussed among all the leaders before one is officially appointed. As with elders, we do not promote based on trophy levels / competitive performance. Maturity is the primary deciding factor.

## What is your BM (bad manners) policy?

- Within the family: Not OK
- Everyone else: OK

The 100T Clan Family does not have any policy against BM’ing random people you face on Ladder, challenges or tournaments.

We do, however, ask that our members not BM each other in the family unless it’s agreed upon beforehand. We understand that there is a mute button but feel that there should be a basic level of respect among fellow 100T members. We do encourage anyone who is offended by emotes to make use of the in-game mute button.

BM’ing family members — in-game without prior agreements, clan chat (being a dick to others), Discord — is a kickable offense. If any 100T member is found to be consistently BM'ing other 100T members then they may be subject to punishment of some sort.


## How can I be part of the competitive team?

We usually make an announcement on Discord whenever we are assembling teams to represent 100T in upcoming tournaments. If there is a try-out,  you should obviously play in one so the team captains can evaluate your game plays. In others, we allow team captains to select their players. If you are new to the family and feel that you are not known among the captains, you can demonstrate your skills by finishing in top spots in 10k tournaments and/or get into the championship rounds for the 100T Tourney, which is held bi-monthly.

### Why are the leaders at the bottom of the roster?

As a well-established clan family in Clash Royale, the 100T Clan Family (100T) is primarily interested in building a top global clan (aka band) in Brawl Stars. To ensure the long-term success of such clan, we feel that strong leadership is required, and we have initiated our effort by placing our best players in CR to form the leadership for Reddit Alpha.

We recognize that CR skills do not necessarily translate to BS skills, and that some of you are concerned that our leadership is currently at the bottom of the roster. In order to ensure the future success of the clan family though, we do feel that having trustworthy co-leaders is a must.

The game is simply too new right now to consider promotions, but it is something that we will definitely be doing in the future. Thank you very much for your patience.

### Can I join Reddit Delta (BS) if I get kicked from Charlie?

### Where can I download Brawl Stars on Android?
