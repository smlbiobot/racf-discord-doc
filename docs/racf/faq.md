# Frequently Asked Questions

<!-- ## What is the RoyaleAPI Clan Family (RoyaleAPI)? -->

<!-- **RoyaleAPI Alpha** is the official clan of **100 Thieves**, an esports team competing in Clash Royale League. The eight clans below comprise the **100 Thieves Clan Family**, which is home to many experienced trophy-pushing and tournament competitors. The clans were created as a result of a merger and re-branding of the Reddit Alpha Clan Family, founded by Woody in January 2016.

## How do I join your clans/bands? -->

Please apply on our Discord https://discord.royaleapi.com

## How do you become an elder?

If you are mature and active in the clan and Discord, we will promote you as an elder after you have been with us for a little while.  Unlike many other CR clans, we do not use donation quota nor crown contribution as a deciding factor when making these decisions. There is currently no set timeframe for when one can become an elder. The decision is completely up to the leader / co-leaders of the clan.

## How do you become a co-leader?

We try to maintain 2-4 co-leaders in each clan. When we require more co-leaders in the clan, the leader will look at all the elders from the entire family and make selections. These will often be discussed among all the leaders before one is officially appointed. As with elders, we do not promote based on trophy levels / competitive performance. Maturity is the primary deciding factor.

## What is your BM (bad manners) policy?

- Within the family: Not OK
- Everyone else: OK

The RoyaleAPI Clan Family does not have any policy against BM’ing random people you face on Ladder, challenges or tournaments.

We do, however, ask that our members not BM each other in the family unless it’s agreed upon beforehand. We understand that there is a mute button but feel that there should be a basic level of respect among fellow RoyaleAPI members. We do encourage anyone who is offended by emotes to make use of the in-game mute button.

BM’ing family members — in-game without prior agreements, clan chat (being a dick to others), Discord — is a kickable offense. If any RoyaleAPI member is found to be consistently BM'ing other RoyaleAPI members then they may be subject to punishment of some sort.


## How can I be part of the competitive team?

We usually make an announcement on Discord whenever we are assembling teams to represent RoyaleAPI in upcoming tournaments. If there is a try-out,  you should obviously play in one so the team captains can evaluate your game plays. In others, we allow team captains to select their players. If you are new to the family and feel that you are not known among the captains, you can demonstrate your skills by finishing in top spots in 10k tournaments and/or get into the championship rounds for the RoyaleAPI Tourney, which is held bi-monthly.
