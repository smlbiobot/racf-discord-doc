# Rules

**Welcome to the home of the 100T Clan Family!** Reddit Alpha is a Global Top 15 clan, founded by Woody, with hundreds of members throughout a thriving feeder system. We are the best place to discuss and practice high-level competitive Clash Royale in a fun and friendly setting. To define our clan family's purpose and promote our members' enjoyment of the game, we establish the following rules:

1. **Treat others with respect.** Refrain from any speech that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, libelous; or racially, sexually, religiously, or otherwise discriminatory in nature.
2. **Play fair.** Play your best in every game, especially against fellow clanmates! Do not post instructions for or use any unauthorized third-party software while playing the game.
3. **Always be pushing.** We value motivated, active players that seek to improve the overall standing of our clan family. If you are \#50 when the clan fills you may be kicked and asked to join a lower clan in our feeder system.
4. **Advance through the feeder system.** Once you are consistently ranked significantly above the trophy minimum of the next higher clan in the feeder system, you are required to move up to the next clan. This does not apply to clan Leaders and Co-Leaders or clans with fewer than 45 members.
5. **Follow Leader instructions.** Leaders and Co-Leaders support and promote active, loyal members to help run the clan. Help them make our clan family the best it can be by following instructions and discussing any issues here or on [our Discord server](http://discord.gg/100t).

## Note for Leaders

Your clan emblem should be set to the Red Rocket and clan location should be set to Niue. The clan description should include a note indicating your current trophy minimum and the next clan above and below you in our feeder system (with clan tags). Your trophy requirement should be set so that it is approximately equal to the ranking of the 25th member in your clan. Please reach out to players via in-game chat, Discord, or clan mail to explain rules 3 & 4 when they will be kicked for being outside of your clan's trophy range.
