# Alpha eSports FAQ

## What is Alpha eSports?

Alpha eSports (AeS) is the newest eSports branch of the RoyaleAPI Clan Family. This clan is intended for members of the clan family who are mostly interested in tournament-level gameplay and are very active in the competitive tournament scene, either as participants or content creators.

## What is the trophy requirement for Alpha eSports?

Alpha eSports does not have a trophy requirement, but all new members must be reviewed either by the leadership of Alpha eSports: Fierylight (Co-Leader), SaintBelikin (Co-Leader), Darthjarjar (Co-Leader).

## What are the benefits for being in the clan?

The benefits of being in the clan are friendly battles, tournament leagues, and having a competitive atmosphere.

## How are members selected?

The members of the clan will be permanent members, no visitors or hoppers. We will choose our members through in-game tryouts, unless they are widely known as really good players. We are working to develop a comprehensive set of guidelines for membership right now.

## How would I know if I have been selected to participate in the tryout?

People who have been selected to participate in the next tryout will be notified on Discord and the email they entered in the application form.

## What should I do if I am no longer interested in Alpha eSports?

You should remove the Recruit role on the RoyaleAPI Discord server https://discord.royaleapi.com by typing `!togglerecruit` in the *bot-commands* channel.

## When will the next tryout be held?

There is no set schedule for when we hold our tryouts. We try to have one every 2 weeks or so. The best you can do is wait for announcement in the *esports-recruiting* channel. All recruits will be tagged (aka mentioned) when it happens.
