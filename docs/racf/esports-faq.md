# Alpha eSports FAQ

## What is Alpha eSports?

Alpha eSports (AeS) is the newest eSports branch of the Reddit Alpha Clan Family. This clan is intended for members of the clan family who are mostly interested in tournament-level gameplay and are very active in the competitive tournament scene, either as participants or content creators.

## What is the trophy requirement for Alpha eSports?

Alpha eSports does not have a trophy requirement, but all new members must be reviewed either by the leadership of Alpha eSports: Slayer (Leader), SaintBelikin (Co-Leader), Darthjarjar (Co-Leader).

## What are the benefits for being in the clan?

The benefits of being in the clan are friendly battles, tournament leagues, and having a competitive atmosphere.

## How are members selected?

The members of the clan will be permanent members, no visitors or hoppers. We will choose our members through in-game tryouts, unless they are widely known as really good players. We are working to develop a comprehensive set of guidelines for membership right now.

## How would I know if I have been selected to participate in the tryout?

People who have been selected to participate in the next tryout will be notified on Discord and the email they entered in the application form.

## What should I do if I am no longer interested in Alpha eSports?

You should remove the Recruit role on the RACF Discord server http://discord.gg/racf by typing `!togglerecruit` in the *bot-commands* channel.

## When will the next tryout be held?

There is no set schedule for when we hold our tryouts. We try to have one every 2 weeks or so. The best you can do is wait for announcement in the *esports-recruiting* channel. All recruits will be tagged (aka mentioned) when it happens.

June, 2017 Update: We are not planning to have another tryout for a while. You are, however, welcome to continue to fill out the application form and we will contact you via Discord and email when that happens.

## What is the tryout format?

+ **Format.** Tryout participants will be divided into two teams, then they will play 1v1 against each other in BO3 sets. Admins will spectate every game that you play and take notes for each player’s performance.
+ **Deck Restrictions.** There are no deck restrictions. You are encouraged to use a variety of decks to showcase your ability to play different archetypes well.
+ **Team assignment.** Teams will be randomly assigned to you on the day of the tryout.
+ **Voice chat.** You must join the voice channel of your team. You are not required to talk if you are unable to, but you must be connected. Talking during your match, however, is strongly recommended.

## Are there any rules during tryouts?

+ **Be punctual.** Please go to the RACF Discord server at least 15 minutes before the time of the tryout. You will be given the name of the tryout clan as well as the password to get in.
+ **Do not request your match until you are told to do so.** The tryout admins will mention in clan chat when you can request your match. Please do not randomly request until it is your turn to do so.
+ **Requests from Team 1 only.** When it is your turn to play, always allow the player from team 1 to request. If you are in Team 2, please do not request your matches.
+ **Put in your opponent’s name in your match request.** Ideally, you should put the name of your opponent in your request so it is clear who you are supposed to be playing against. You will know who that is because the admin will announce that in clan chat.
+ **No chatting in clan.** Please don’t use the clan chat for chatting / nagging admins to let you play your games first. Repeat offenders will be banned.
+ **No card requests.** Please don’t use the clan to request cards. 

## How will players be selected from the tryouts?

Tryout admins will be present in your team’s voice channel during tryout. He/she will spectate every game the team participate in and take notes regarding each player’s performance in terms of gameplay, strategy, elixir management, willingness to speak in voice chat, ability to play different decks, card placement, etc.

Players are judged individually. How their team perform overall does not affect whether a player will ultimately be selected or rejected. Additionally, winning all matches does not guarantee a spot if you were matched against a bad player and you did not show skills in your games.

## How will I know if I have been selected from the tryouts?

We will notify you if you have made it to the team on Discord once we have made our decisions. The number of players that will be picked is not set in stone. We may choose to pick 10, or we may choose to pick none. It all depends on the player’s individual performance during the tryout.

## Is there any tips you can give me for my tryouts?

* **Use a variety of decks. **You are not showing versatility if you use the same deck for every single match.
* **Don’t use wtf off-meta decks in every game.** Your objective should be to win every game. While you can play any deck you like, playing all matches with off-meta decks might throw the admins off. If in doubt, try to play at least one meta deck to show that you are at least aware of what’s meta right now.
* **Try to voice chat.** While VC is not strictly a requirement, if you demonstrate good thought process while playing, it will make an impression.

## Additional requirements for prospective applicants

* **Basic English comprehension skills. **You must be able to read and comprehend English. We reserve the right to reject your application for tryouts if you have shown that you are unable to read simple instructions.
* **Basic English writing skills. **You must be able to write in English. While we welcome players from around the globe, we cannot guarantee that there will be a translator available at all times.
* **Ability to convert time zone information. **Tryout information may be given out in a time zone that’s not local to you. You should learn to use Google to convert standard timezone information e.g. EST to CEST or GMT, etc.
* **Follow the instructions of the Tryout Admins. **During tryouts, you may be requested to join different voice channels, request battles at a specific order. We reserve the right to disqualify applicants who kept on refusing to comply, repeatedly asking questions that have already been posted in instructions, and/or being generally disruptive to the process.
