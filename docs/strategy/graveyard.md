## Overview

**Graveyard** has been released for a while now but do you know the most optimal placement? This time I asked **Grimear** [/u/Grimear](http://reddit.com/u/Grimear) to help me write this guide. Grimear has been playing GY for both ladder and challenges. Last season, he finished with 5,608 trophies (PB) and a global 4,237th rank with a level 3 Graveyard. He is the Leader of Reddit Foxtrot, one of the feeder clans in the 100T Clan Family.

## Strategy

### 1. Best for Giant Graveyard

This placement (B24, Q24) will never activate the King’s Tower. This will spawn skeletons around the tanking unit and maybe even take advantage of a  pre-planted Inferno Tower.

### 2. Better against Valkyrie

You can get sneaky chip damage this way (B25, Q25) but be aware that this has a low risk of activating the King’s Tower.

### 3. Best vs Elixir Collector

Playing Graveyard on this spot (C24, P24) will not activate the King’s Tower and the Larries will attack the Pump (I24, J24) instead.

### X. Not optimal

Graveyard is ineffective if placed from this spot (B22, Q22) or below. You want the skeletons to spawn from at least 3 sides, especially when the opponent has Valkyrie.

## General Graveyard Tips

1. You want at least **2 spells** that can clear swarms in a GY deck for it to be effective.
2. Graveyard decks call for good **elixir management**. It is a 5-elixir investment that can either pay off or hurt you. If you try to force a GY during a dead push, it’ll just help the opponent build a stronger counter attack.
3. You need to **know the opponent’s cycle** and keep track of their elixir. Try to Graveyard when counters are out of their hands or they are low on elixir!
4. **Graveyard decks should not be too expensive** in case you need to out-cycle your opponent. Unless you’re running Splashyard, your deck shouldn’t be above 3.5.
5. Always **try and get value out of Graveyard**. If the opponent plays musketeer at the back, try and attack the same side!
6. If you’re in a tough spot, you can even use GY **defensively** against high-DPS, single-shot units. If left alone, a defensive GY can even  kill Elite-Barbarians, Prince, Pekka, Mini Pekka, and others.
7. **Try and play tricky**. If you’re ahead on elixir and damage without using GY, don’t use it until double elixir or the very end!
	* It is possible to win matches without ever using Graveyard. A lot of it is a psychological game. If your opponent is used to the same pattern of pushes switch it up.
	* For example, let’s say you place a small unit at the back before placing Giant at the bridge and GY in the same lane. After a while the opponent will recognize that as the start of a GY push and they will pre-plant their counters. That’s when you suddenly push the other lane and take down a tower!

Note: A lot of these tips are **situational** depending on the type of GY deck you're running — Bowler Freeze, GY Poison cycle, Splashyard, Giyard, Golem.
