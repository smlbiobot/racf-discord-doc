## Description

A question popped up in the #strategy channel on the RoyaleAPI (RoyaleAPI Clan Family) Discord server recently: should I upgrade my pump from level 10 to 11?

To answer this question, Schmanik /u/schmanik made a spreadsheet to target interactions with pumps at 10, 11 against fireball at 10, 11 and poison 7, 8. I expanded on his spreadsheet and did calculations across all levels.

### Should I upgrade my pump?

The chart on the left shows the amount of elixir produced after either fireball / poison is cast, with the cell highlighted where there is a change in interaction.

#### Examples:

1. Your pump is level 7 and you face level 7 fireballs most of the time: upgrading your pump to level 8 will produce one more elixir (thus giving you an advantage).
2. Your pump is level 8 and you face level 7 fireballs most of the time: upgrading your pump to level 9 does not change any interactions.
3. Your pump is level 10 and you face max fireball: upgrading your pump will not change interactions. However, if you face max poison, your level 11 pump _will_ produce one more elixir. If you don’t face max poison that often, you shouldn’t upgrade.

### Elixir advantage after pump dies

The chart on the right shows the elixir advantage after the elixir collector dies. Since the Elixir Collector costs 6 elixir and outputs 8 elixir total, 2 is the normal advantage that you gain. Depending on the different levels, you will either gain additional or less advantage.

### Elixir Trade: Positive or Negative

Whether to fireball a pump is highly situational and subjective. Unless you are using a rocket, you will note that your opponent will still gain 1 additional elixir after it has been fireball’ed or poisoned. Whether it is worth the trade depends highly if that elixir trades equally with the addional tower damage, troop damage, etc.
