## Description

This is part 2 of **tornado** placement, where we look at optimal placement against common ground troops + tanks, as well as Miner.

## Strategy

* **1.** When opponent plays **Ice Golem / Valkyrie / Elite Barbarians / Bandits / other ground troops** from the left, this (H25) is the optimal tile to place your tornado if you wish to activate the King’s Tower.
* **2.** This tile (H24) prevents more damage than 1 when played against **Giant / Golem / Knight / Guards**.
* **1.** If **Miner** is placed in front of the Arena Tower, placing tornado on this tile (H25) will activate King’s Tower.
* **3.** If **Miner** is placed anywhere except the top right diagonal, placing tornado on this tile (K27) will activate King’s Tower.
* If **Miner** is placed on these tiles (A23, B22, Q22, R23) on either side, there is not a tornado placement that can activate the King’s Tower. These are also the same tiles that the King’s Tower can’t hit when an Arena Tower is down.
