## Overview

The **Mortar cycle** deck (aka _the_ F2P Ladder Deck due to its 6 commons, 1 rare and 1 legendary card composition) has been very popular lately. However, many people who are new to mortar find it difficult to play against certain archetypes / cards on the ladder.

I have asked **Predator** [/u/ArcaneForgery](http://reddit.com/u/ArcaneForgery), who finished last season at 1,336th global with 13/10/x/4 to demonstrate how to play this correctly.

Please tag [/u/ArcaneForgery](http://reddit.com/u/ArcaneForgery) if you have question about the strategies. Additionally, you can join the RoyaleAPI Discord server at https://discord.royaleapi.com if you would like to speak to him directly.

## Strategy

### A. 1. LavaLoon

- Forces them to defend, not push
- Makes easy rocket lineups
- Can destroy elixir collector between towers

Optimal placement against LavaLoon, or any sort of Lava Hound deck. Due to having only archers and ice spirit as air defense in mortar cycle, it's crucial that you utilize your spells and mortar as options to improve your defense. This placement pulls the Lava Hound and the balloon, so long as it is not placed in the opposite lane from the Lava Hound. This will not only pull, but provide pressure by forcing the opponent to counter the mortar, or risk tower damage, as well as make it easier to line up a defensive rocket to crush their push. Note that this placement is also effective at taking out elixir pumps placed in between both princess towers.

### A. 2. Hog

- Prevents from supporting hog, forces defense
- Has longer pull, lets tower shoot hog more

This is the optimal hog placement. This placement is preferred to the regular placement of the mortar due to the fact that in most cases, the hog is pulled farther. This allows for more time for your tower and defensive troops to kill the hog. This placement also provides pressure, forcing your opponent to stop focusing on supporting their hog, and shift attention to defending the mortar. If they don't defend the mortar, it can often connect a shell or two even with the hog swinging at it.

### B. 3. Royal Giant

- RG locks on, but lets support pass
- Keeps mortar alive longer to tank

This is the optimal placement against royal giant. This placement allows the royal giant to lock onto the mortar, tanking shots, while letting any support troops ignore it. That keeps the mortar alive longer, allowing you to focus on eliminating their support, then finishing off the royal giant.

### B. 4. Golem + Large Tanks

- Same idea as RG placement
- As it pulls tank, eliminate support
- Often allows for counterpush with support troops

This placement is utilized primarily for defense against large tanks, and is the same as the optimal RG placement. It's the same idea, pull the golem/giant/rg and eliminate the support troops with your troops, allowing your defensive troops to walk over and finish up the tank after finishing the support, and potentially counter-push.
