## Description

Back to basics! This is a beginner’s guide to **Elixir Collector** placement. We have decided to throw this guide together after facing opponents with questionable pump placement in challenges.

## Strategy

There are four viable placements:

### 1. In front of King’s Tower

* **Best against Graveyard**
* **Good vs Rocket / Miner**
* **Bad vs Poison**
* The X-Bow / Mortar / Hog will target the elixir collector before the tower and will destroy the elixir pump.
* This spot is great against miner as it is less punishing if you guess the miner position incorrectly.

### 2.	Next to King’s Tower

* **Good vs Graveyard**
* This spot forces opponent to place the Graveyard in a position that could activate the king tower.

### 3. Corner

* **Good vs Fireball / Poison**
* **Bad vs Rocket / Graveyard**
* Always place the pump on the side with the higher-hp Arena Tower.

### 4. 1 Tile from Corner

* Pick this spot if opponent has **Goblin Barrel**. Because of a Log bug that prevents the Log being played on top of buildings, you won’t be able to defend your pump with the Log if it is placed on the corner tile 3.
