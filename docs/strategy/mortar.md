## Strategy

As promised, here is a basic illustrated guide for proper mortar placement.

Detailed explanation for the 3 placements written by **6John** (/u/6Dad)

1. General best mortar placement if no countering anything
2. vs RG specifically and any other ground based tank to pull toward mortar. When the tank has reached the mortar's blind spot, the mortar will start shooting at the support troops with splash dmg. also use other units to take out support, can use skele/archers to help take out tank
3. vs hog, hog will be in the blind spot, so mortar will hit the tower, if the hog is pig pushed this is the furthest placement. If the hog is not pig pushed, you can move it one tile to the left to pull the hog. this placement by itself will not take out the hog, so need to use something else Ice spirit/ skele/ archer/ knight, what have you to take out the hog
