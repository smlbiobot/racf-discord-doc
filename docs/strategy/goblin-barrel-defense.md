## Description

When predicting Goblin Barrel, you want to focus on where the Barrel is in (1) mid-air when the (2) shadow of the Barrel crosses the river.

In each of the screenshots, the shadow is in the exact same spot in each screenshot, but you can see that the Barrel is in different positions mid-air.

As you can also see, the (3) landed Goblins denote where the Barrelâ€™s final destination is to use a prediction Log/Spell.

(For illustration purposes there are landed Goblins and a mid-air Barrel in each screenshot.)
