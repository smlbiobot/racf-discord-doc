## Strategy

Following the previous posts, **6John** (/u/6dad) has decided that we would take a look at how to play the **Musketeer** optimally.

1. **Princess.** If Princess is placed at the bridge (on this tile or the one closer to the middle), you can snipe her and continue to target the other tower.
2. **Hog.** If Giant is placed behind the tower and opponent plays Hog at the river, you can snipe the Hog and continue to support the Giant.
3. **LavaLoon.** With 4x2 Inferno Tower plant and Musketeer at this placement, Lightning cannot hit both targets.
4. **Tank + Graveyard.** Against Tank + Graveyard, place Skeletons first, then Musketeer at this placement. Musketeer cannot be fireball/poisoned. Hover The Log in case of emergency.
5. **Building.** Any building placed 3 tiles from the river can be sniped by the Musketeer.
