## Description

I have played CR for a year now, but I am still a complete n00b when it comes to defensive building placement because I have always played beatdown and the Inferno Tower is not normally in my decks. Recently I have started playing the hog log bait deck so I asked /u/min_58 to help me with the optimal placements against different troops.

He sent me a bunch of screenshots which I thought are useful, so I have compiled this image as an illustrated guide, which I hope will help anyone who may still be struggling to play defensive structures at the correct tiles for maximum effect.
