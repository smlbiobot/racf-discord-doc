## Description

The optimal placement posts continue with… **tornado**. This time I asked the strategy provider **Min** /u/min_58 to post so that he can answer your questions more easily.

_Because there seems to be some inconsistency re: how people name the tiles, we have included labels for columns + rows for each tile so we can more reliably discuss the exact tiles in question._

## Strategy

1.	If **Hog is pig-pushed** from the left, placing the tornado on this tile (H25) will activate King’s Tower and take a single hit from the Hog.
2. If **Hog is not pig-pushed**, placing tornado on this tile (I22) will activate King’s Tower and receive no hits.
3. Once the King’s Tower has been activated, placing tornado on this tile (I20) can prevent all hits from the Hog.
4. If **Goblin Barrel** is thrown at the center of the right tower, placing tornado on these tiles (K26, L27) will activate the King’s Tower and the Arena Tower will receive one hit from a goblin.
5. Once the King’s Tower has been activated, placing tornado on this tile (K22) will eliminate all hits from a **Goblin Barrel**.

## PS

[Part 2](strategy/tornado2.md) talks about tornado placement against Miner / Bandit / Ebarbs / Knight and is already in the works. Stay tuned.
