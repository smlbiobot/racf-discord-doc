## Strategy

Following the previous posts, weâ€™ve decided to take a look at one of my favorite cards **Princess**. As you all know by now, I am the first F2p Player to reach 5000 trophies with a Level 4 Princess.

1. **Mega Minion.** If Mega Minion is on the outer edge, place Princess here to snipe (without taking tower damage).
2. **Furnace.** Place Princess on this tile to snipe the first wave of Fire Spirts and target Furnace 2 tiles from the river (giving you space to protect Princess).
3. **Lava Hound.** Place Princess here once Lava Hound has locked onto tower to protect from Miner snipe.
4. **Golem + Minions.** Place Princess here to help with Minions clear but to spread out troops for anti-spells.
5. **Minion Horde + Miner.** Note: (1) and (2) denotes two separate situations) 1st time around place Princess (1) here to snipe from cross map, 2nd time around place Princess (2) here in case opp. tries to predict Princess.
