User /u/ShookaBriat left a comment on the [previous post](strategy/musketeer.md) asking for **building placement against hog**, so here it is. The subredditâ€™s mod + CR super-star **Xhadian** (/u/Xhadian) offered to help me out this time.

1. **Normal.** Perfect placement vs Hog. Also works: 1-tile up: but will be in range of Musketeer. 1-tile down: smaller time window after Hog is placed.
2. **Anti-Lightning.** You will need an additional defensive troop (e.g. Ice Spirit) if you do not want a single hit by the Hog.
3. **Will not pull.** After true blue / red fix, Hog will always pig-push by himself, thus building on opposite lane will no longer pull Hog.
