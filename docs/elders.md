If you are mature and active in the clan and Discord, we will promote you as an elder after you have been with us for a little while. Unlike many other CR clans, we do not use donation quota nor crown contribution as a deciding factor when making these decisions. There is currently no set timeframe for when one can become an elder. The decision is completely up to the leader / co-leaders of the clan.

## Responsibilities

You have the following responsibilities as an elder in the 100T:

1. Accept new members.
2. When accepting new members, you should:
    - Make sure that the person meets trophy requirements.
    - Ask if the person is new to the 100T.
    - Ask that person to join our Discord server: http://discord.gg/100t
    - Let them know about the 50/50 kicking policy.
3. Not allowed to kick 50/50.
