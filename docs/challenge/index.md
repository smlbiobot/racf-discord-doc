# Challenge

We are going to be starting new bi-weekly challenges designed to help the family learn different deck styles & meta decks to help us continue to get better at clan wars.  For these challenges, you’ll be provided with a strong challenge deck and you’ll play in either Grand or Classic Challenges to win a special discord role for two weeks.  

The goal is to give you detailed tips on how to play so you can learn different types of deck interactions and get more experience with deck archetypes you might not normally play.

| Rules | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Challenge | Play a meta deck and get 12+ wins in challenge (CC or GC) — first GC win chooses color |
| Time Frame | 2 weeks |
| Prize | Special discord role when you complete the challenge (expires 1 week after challenge ends) |
