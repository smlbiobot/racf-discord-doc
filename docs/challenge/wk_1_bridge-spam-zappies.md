## Strategy

While this is a bridge spam variant, you generally won't be spamming.  What you want to do is set up big pushes with your slow units (IG, Zappies, ID) and then get your fast units down at the bridge to meet them for a very powerful attack.  This deck can be a high-pressure deck and is flexible: you can snowball down one lane or split-push both lanes similar to Three Musketeers.

### Starting Cards

1. Your best opening play is usually to split Zappies in the back.
2. If you don't have Zappies available, Ice Golem is a good second option to buy time and see what they play.
    - Note: If they play nothing, toss your Bandit or Dark Prince behind to start your push with a 2-elixir advantage.
3. If they pump with their opening move, your best move is to 10-elixir punish at the bridge.  Ice Golem (2), Ram (4), Dark Prince (4).
4. If they drop a large tank in the back, use a similar 10-elixir punish in the opposite lane to force them to commit to responding.  Stop their large tank with your Inferno Dragon when it crosses the river.


### Positive Matchups
This deck is generally strong against beatdown decks and has a net win % of more than 10% against the following meta decks:

- PEKKA/Miner/Poison (+30%)
- Golem Beatdown (+30%)
- Xbow/Tesla (+27%)
- Giant/Double Prince (+25%)

### Difficult Matchups

This deck struggles against mortar decks, hog cycle variants, and log bait.  There's some weakness to air units, so you'll need to make sure you work on timing your Ice Golem + Zap combination to deal with minion hordes and watch for Balloons.  PEKKA can also be a challenge when supported with other strong win-conditions as she can be a nightmare defensively, stopping your bandit / dark prince / battle ram.  The following meta decks have a net win % of 10% or more against our deck:

- PEKKA/Ram/EWiz Bridge Spam (-39%)
- Hog/IWiz/Nado 3.0 Cycle (-31%)
- Log Bait (-30%)
- Loon Miner Cycle (-24%)
- Hog 3M (-19%)
- 3M DP Miner Horde Pump (-10%)
