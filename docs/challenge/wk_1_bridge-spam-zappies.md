## Strategy

While this is a bridge spam variant, you generally won't be spamming.  What you want to do is set up big pushes with your slow units (IG, Zappies, ID) and then get your fast units down at the bridge to meet them for a very powerful attack.  This deck can be a high-pressure deck and is flexible: you can snowball down one lane or split-push both lanes similar to Three Musketeers.

### Starting Cards

1. Your best opening play is usually to split Zappies in the back.
2. If you don't have Zappies available, Ice Golem is a good second option to buy time and see what they play.
    - Note: If they play nothing, toss your Bandit or Dark Prince behind to start your push with a 2-elixir advantage.
3. If they pump with their opening move, your best move is to 10-elixir punish at the bridge.  Ice Golem (2), Ram (4), Dark Prince (4).
4. If they drop a large tank in the back, use a similar 10-elixir punish in the opposite lane to force them to commit to responding.  Stop their large tank with your Inferno Dragon when it crosses the river.


### Positive Matchups
This deck is generally strong against beatdown decks and has a net win % of more than 10% against the following meta decks:

- PEKKA/Miner/Poison (+30%)
- Golem Beatdown (+30%)
- Xbow/Tesla (+27%)
- Giant/Double Prince (+25%)

### Difficult Matchups

This deck struggles against mortar decks, hog cycle variants, and log bait.  There's some weakness to air units, so you'll need to make sure you work on timing your Ice Golem + Zap combination to deal with minion hordes and watch for Balloons.  PEKKA can also be a challenge when supported with other strong win-conditions as she can be a nightmare defensively, stopping your bandit / dark prince / battle ram.  The following meta decks have a net win % of 10% or more against our deck:

- PEKKA/Ram/EWiz Bridge Spam (-39%)
- Hog/IWiz/Nado 3.0 Cycle (-31%)
- Log Bait (-30%)
- Loon Miner Cycle (-24%)
- Hog 3M (-19%)
- 3M DP Miner Horde Pump (-10%)

## Replay notes

### Replay 1: Our Deck vs. Miner/Balloon Cycle

https://www.replayroyale.com/v/tv1525273514_0

Result: Our deck loses 1-0 to miner/balloon, but keeps it close.

| MM:SS | Description
| --- | ---
| 0:47 | The fireball value is huge — takes down two zappies, the rest of an inferno dragon, and sets up the next push.
| 1:00 | Because ID is down, the push with miner/balloon easily takes our tower.  We decided to try to punish with bandit and dark prince and took half of the tower.
| 2:20 | The split push by our side almost takes the left tower.  The dark prince knocks out the tombstone allowing the battle ram to connect and the bandit dashes from the right side to the left to connect and deal some additional damage.
| 3:00  | Even though this deck is tough, with a little more time it could have turned into a win as we had Inferno Dragon ready to deal with the Balloon and had more damage down on their right tower.

> Key Takeaway: Inferno Dragon is one of your most important units and you can get punished big-time if you mis-play it.

### Replay 2: Our Deck vs. Lavaloon

https://www.replayroyale.com/v/tv1524603945_0

Result: After taking the lead, we lose 2-1 in OT -- both towers went down due to misplayed Inferno Dragons

| MM:SS | Description
| --- | ---
| 0:58 |  We play an Inferno Dragon in support of a Battle Ram -- it gets taken down by the minions which sets up the next push.
| 1:30 |  A solo balloon goes after our tower and the only defense is zappies that catch a fireball — 50% of our tower is down, but we snag 33% of theirs.
| 2:40 | Lavaloon key push builds on the right while we take the left tower
| 2:44 |  Inferno Dragon is dropped too close to river and loses connection with Balloon (tower lost).
| 3:05 |  We drop our Inferno Dragon by the river next to two Mega Minions.  Middle balloon finishes us off.

### Replay 3: Our Deck vs. Log Bait

https://www.replayroyale.com/v/tv1524503142_0

Result: 1-0 with the win coming on a final snowball push.

| MM:SS | Description
| --- | ---
| 0:25 | Our dark prince takes care of their goblin gang, but gets tornado'd to activate king tower (deals 33% damage to left tower)
| 0:32 | We fireball their goblin barrel for a -1 elixir trade, but take no damage.
| 1:00 | Our zappies laugh at their knight.
| 1:28 | Example of zappies + zap taking care of business against swarms (GG and GB)
| 2:15 | Another good zappie interaction -- zappies in the back to support and with the help of zap, cleans up a GB on the way for minimal damage.
| 3:05 | Fireballs for princesses, too and they help us by mis-playing the next GB.
| 3:20  | Final push... Dark Prince cleans up GB.  IG, Zappies, Ram all go down at the bridge -- Bandit follows. GGWP.
