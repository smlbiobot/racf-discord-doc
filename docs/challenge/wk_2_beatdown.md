# Challenge 2: Beatdown Paths -- Golem vs. Giant

This challenge will offer you two paths towards a special discord role.  You can do either of the paths or, if you really want, jump in and do them both!  If you complete both your color will be whichever role we place higher in the role hierarchy (no customization!).
