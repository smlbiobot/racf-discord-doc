# Quotes

A bit like custom commands, but stored on a subcommand level so as not to pollute the pool of available words for use with commands.

`!quoteset` or `!qs`

Subcommand | Description | Permissions
--- | --- | ---
add	/ a | Adds a quote | MOD
remove / rm	| Removes a quote | MOD
edit / e | Edits a quote | MOD
list / l | Shows a list of quotes | everyone

`!quote` or `!q`

Display quotes by name, e.g. `!q cran`

Similar to custom commands you may store images via Discordâ€™s auto image preview expansions.

## Examples

`!qs a racf RACF is awesome!`

`!q racf`
