# Kicking 50/50

When your clan becomes full, you are required to kick the last person (50/50) in the clan. You should do so as soon as it happens.

The only times that we do not kick 50/50 are:
- 12 hrs before clan chest starts. This is to ensure that people will have time to participate in clan chest.
- 12 hrs after clan chest has finishesd. This is to ensure that people will have time to open their chests.
- 48 hrs after season resets. This is also known as the grace period.

## Procedure

- Announce in clan that you are kicking 50/50 by saying `50/50` in clan chat.
- Demote the member if necessary.
- Kick
- Go to #bot-commands and run the command `!k5 @User`. This command does the following:
    - Remove the clan tag from the user.
    - Send them a DM explaining why they have been kicked from the clan.
    - Advise them to join a lower feeder.

## Rules

- Co-leaders are not exempt from being kicked.
- Elders are not allowed to kick 50/50.
