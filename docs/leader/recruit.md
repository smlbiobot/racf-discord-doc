# Recruitment

Recruiting members for our clans is one of the most important responsibilities for Co-Leaders and Leaders. The exact procedure differs from clan to clan, but generally follow these steps:

* If a player requests to join your clan in-app:
    * Check that members meet the basic requirements (minimum 12 challenge wins, decent PB)
    * Use bot commands `!cwr`, `!cwrt` to check clan war readiness (CWR).
    * Accept / reject based on these criteria, and direct new member to join Discord.
    * If you wish to secure a player based on basic stats, you can accept first and check stats afterwards. If you decide to reject the player following the acceptance, you should kick with a message and ask them to join Discord to apply.
* If a player requests to join from Discord:
    * Run `!recruit` or `!re` command with the playerâ€™s tag. This will put the player in our `#recruit` channel and you can discuss with other clan leaders in `#recruit-discussion` regarding which clan would be the best fit.
* When a new player has joined your clan:
    * Direct them to join Discord
    * Run [`!r v`](leader/new-users) to verify their membership on Discord.

## Clan War Readiness (CWR)

**Clan War Readiness (CWR)** is how well your cards are leveled for the clan wars league you're playing in. Most of our clans look for 30 to 50%+ of your cards to be leveled within your league. Most of our clans are in the legendary league, so we'll focus there as an example:

Legendary League Standard is 12/10/7/4, so your Legendary League Readiness % is based on the number of cards at that level or higher.  Again, 30-50%+ is the standard we look for today.

In Legendary League, you can also see +1 levels (Legendary League Readiness or 13/11/8/5 -- max cards) when you battle, so a player with 50% Legendary Readiness is better off than someone with 5% Legendary when it comes to building strong decks to go to battle with.

!> CWR is a measure that is unique to our family, as implemented on [RoyaleAPI.com](https://royaleapi.com). Players may not be familiar with the term. You can show the definition of CWR by running the bot command [`!q cwr`](leader/quotes)

## Bot Commands

| Command | Alias | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!recruit @user` | `!re @user` | Add the Recruit role to user and place them into the `#recruit` channel |
| `!recruit @user C0G20PR2` | `!re @user C0G20PR2` | **Preferred.** Add the Recruit role to user and also assign player tag in the same step.  |
| `!cwready @user` | `!cwr @user` | Show the CWR of a user. Note: this will only work if a player tag has been associated. |
| `!cwreadytag @user` | `!cwrt @user` | Show the CWR of a player tag. This is great for checking CWR for any players. |
