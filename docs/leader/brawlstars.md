# Brawl Stars

All the Brawl Stars commands are grouped under the base command `!brawlstars` with the alias `!bs`

| Command | Shortcut | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!bs verify` | `!bs v` | Verify members as part of our clubs and assign relevant roles. |
| `!bs profile` | `!bs p` | Display player profile. |
| `!bs search` | `!bs s` | Search for members by name. |

## Verify

After members have joined our clubs, you should direct them to join our Discord https://discord.gg/100t and when they show up in `#welcome`, run this command and assign roles for them.

After they told you that they are playing Brawl Stars, you will run:

```
!brawlstars verify @SML#6443 889QC9
```
Or use the shortcut:

```
!bs v @SML#6443 889QC9
```

This will assign the player tag to the user, change their nickname to match the IGN, and give them relevant roles to access our member channels.

## Profile

When a user has had their tags registered, they can check their player profile with this command:

```
!brawlstars profile
```
or shortcut:
```
!bs p
```

You can additionally check the profile of another member by adding their mention:
```
!bs p @SML#6443
```

## Search

If a user doesn’t know how to locate their player tag, but you know that he is in our clubs, you can search for them. This command takes one argument and is a case-insensitive text search — so don’t use the mention syntax here.

```
!brawlstars search sml
```
or shortcut:
```
!bs s sml
```
