# Greetings

You should welcome members who join the family, tell them about our kicking policy and join our Discord server. You can type your own messages, but there are some samples which work well in the past:

## Welcoming new users

1. Welcome to the Reddit Alpha Clan Family (RACF)! Please join our Discord http://discord.gg/racf (also in clan description)
2. We kick the 50/50 as soon as it happens, unless it is during clan chest and 12 hrs before and after the event.
3. If you get kicked, pls join one of our feeders. RACF clans are Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel with the red rocket emblem.

## Welcoming members moving from another clan

1. Are you on the RACF Discord server? If not, please join: http://discord.gg/racf
2. Pls type !changeclan Delta on Discordâ€™s #bot-commands to update your clan.
