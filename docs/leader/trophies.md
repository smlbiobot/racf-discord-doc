# Trophy Requirements



## API

The trophy requirement commands, `!clans` for Clash Royale and `!bands` for Brawl Stars, decipher the trophy requirements in each clan / band automatically from the in-game clan description.

- Set your trophy requirements in clan using numbers or numbers with commas, e.g. `4400` or `4,400`
- Do not use other random numbers in the description.
- Because of censorship, please set requirements for 4.2k as `4,2OO` (letter 0). The cog will convert them to numbers on Discord.
- If season has just reset, you may add `PB` after the number to designate that we are using personal best. Please donâ€™t use these two characters to describe anything else, otherwise it will be displayed.
- You may optionally use `PSF` which stands for `Previous Season Finish` to describe your trophy requirement after season resets.
