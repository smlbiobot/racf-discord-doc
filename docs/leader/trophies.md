# Trophy Requirements

## Clash Royale

### Show

To display the table, type `!trophies show`

Shortcut is `!tr show`

### Set

Co-leaders and above have permissions to set the trophies requirement. e.g. `!trophies set Delta 4300`

By default, the trophy requirements take a number only. If you would like to set a PB, you can work around like this:

`!trophies set Delta "4,300 PB"`

## Brawl Stars

Same as Clash Royale syntax but with the _bs_ prefix.

`!bstr show`

`!bstr set`
