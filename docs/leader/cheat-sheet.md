# Cheat Sheet

| Command | Example | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| `!r v @person playertag` | `!r v @SML C0G20PR2` | Use this on all members or visitors that give you a player tag. This is needed for the audit.
| `!v @person` | `!v @Bob` | If they are a visitor or don't reply. However if they are a visitor and provide a player tag they can be done with the previous command.
| `!crsettag playertag @person` | `!crsettag C0G20PR2 SML` | To set a player tag to a player. This is needed for audit and to use `!cpg` for player profile.

Please give people a chance to respond in #welcome before adding roles because they will not be able to see that channel once they are a visitor. If you give roles make sure to continue to help them in `#visitors`.

Give people that break rules more than three minutes to correct it or get kicked, this is bad practice. Most of the time they can be reminded of the rules and we can all move on in a good direction.
