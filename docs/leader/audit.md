# Auditing

Leaders should perform periodic audits on their clans to make sure that the Discord membership + roles are the same as that in-app.

- Verify that members with the clan tag on Discord are in fact in the clan in-app. If not, remove clan tag from Discord (but do not remove the Member role).
- Note the list of members in the clan who are not on Discord and ask them to join the Discord server.
- Assign clan roles to members.
- After all the clans have completed their audits, people with only the Member role on the server but without any clan assignments can be changed to Visitor.
