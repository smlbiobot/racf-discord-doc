    description: >
      The RoyaleAPI Clan Family was originally known as the Reddit Alpha Clan Family and then briefly as the 100 Thieves Clan Family. Home to professional players that eventually moved on to play at CRNAO, King’s Cup, and CRL, our family fosters an environment where casual and competitive styles of play can both flourish.


      Our clan family boasts a top 25 global flagship clan and a system of feeder clans where we help our players learn, grow, and enhance their skills through a highly active & supportive Discord server.

      :crossed_swords: Royale Rating
    description: >
      Royale Rating (RR), developed by RoyaleAPI, aims to give each player a score related to their skill. The rating system tackles several disadvantage of Elo and is able to quickly hone into an individual’s true skill rating in a short amount of time. Additionally, the system can calculate ratings for individual players even when they participate in multi-player settings, e.g. 2v2 and more.  More information can be found in our documentation.
