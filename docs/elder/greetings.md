# Greetings

When members join our clans, you should:
- Direct the new member to the discord and explain that it's important for war: http://discord.gg/100t
- Let them know that we are war-focused and review every new member to meet criteria to make us successful
- Tag a co-leader on discord to let them know a new member has joined

You can write your own messages but if you find yourself typing the same messages frequently, you may wish to save these in your keyboard shortcut (aka text replacement).

Here are some sample messages which work well.
