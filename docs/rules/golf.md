# Golf

## War Day

Failing to attack when you are participating in war will be followed by an immediate kick.

## Collection Day

If youâ€™ve failed to participate on Collection Day, you have 2 hours after collection day to DM anyone from Golf leadership on Discord with your reasons for not participating. We will  discuss the validity of your reasons and decide whether or not you will keep your spot in the clan.
