# Bravo

Please read the rules carefully and react to the pinned message in `#bravo` channel with ✅ to acknowledge that you have read it.

## Basics

1. People who do not meet the requirements of Bravo can still request to join. Accept them and kick them right after by using a custom kick message, e.g.:
    - Please join http://discord.gg/100T to apply — thanks for your interest!
2. When you play with someone from your own clan, please don’t BM each other unless you guys have a prior agreement.

## Clan Wars

Regarding Clan Wars, we are aiming to get to Legendary League, and we would not be able to do it without you guys! We appreciate everything that you have done so far to push us as high as possible, but we think that we can improve on our clan war culture.

1. **No war battles within first 30 minutes**. Please do not attack within the first 30 minutes of a war. (If this is the only time you can play your war match, please discuss it with leadership.) We have implemented this rule since we *do* lose a lot of our war matches in the beginning of war day and would like to slow things down a bit.
2. **Practice at least 3 times**. Play at least 3 practice matches. Practicing plays a very important role in winning your war day battles. You can do this in any mode: Ladder, Challenges (CC/GC), In-Clan Friendly (War Deck / 1v1 Friendly against other archetypes).
3. **Practice with clan mates even after you have battled**. You should be helping players who haven’t played their war day battle by practicing with them, even if you have already played yours.
4. **Read war analysis + approved decks**. For every war, there will be a war analysis posted on Discord accompanied by a list of approved decks. You should read this and select one of these decks to play. These decks have been carefully crafted to ensure the highest winning changes. Let us know you read this analysis by adding the ✅  as a reaction. (We do take Discord activity in consideration when we need a free spot in our clan.)
5. **Deck approvals**. If you decide that you are not able or capable of playing one of the approved decks, you *can* create your own deck. However, before going in, please make sure that ask for deck approvals by tagging `@BravoDeckApprover` on Discord, together with a screenshot of the deck or using a deck bot command. If you decide to player your war day battle in without any approvals, you might risk a kick.
    - Screenshot of deck.
    - Posting deck link. The bot will translate it into an image automagically.
    - Use the `!deck` command. `!deck get hog 1m ig skeletons is log cannon fb` will post the deck as an image with links to copy decks.
6. **Fun**. Maybe the most important rule — have fun!

If you have any questions, please contact a member of the leadership.

Give this the pinned post a ✅ after you have read it.
