# Bravo

Please read the rules carefully and react to the pinned message in `#bravo` channel with ✅ to acknowledge that you have read it.

## Basic rules

1. People who do not meet the requirements of Bravo and still request to join, accept them and kick them straight after telling them to join our discord for consideration by using the message tab when you kick someone.
2. When you play someone from your own clan be aware of the fact you don’t BM unless you guys have a prior agreement.

## Clan Wars

Regarding Clan Wars, we at Bravo are aiming to get to Legendary League, we can absolutely not do this without you guys! We appreciate everything you guys do in order to get as high as possible but we still think there are some struggles around our war culture we have at Bravo. So according to that we like to introduce some small rules.

1. **No war battles within first 10 minutes**. Please do not attack within the first 30 minutes of a war. (If this is the only moment you can actually play your war match, discuss it with the leadership.) We have implemented this rule since we *do* lose a lot of our war matches in the beginning of war day and would like to slow things down a bit.
2. **Practice at least 3 times**. Play at least 3 practice matches. Practicing plays a very important role in winning your matches. You can do this in any mode: Ladder, Challenges (CC/GC), In-Clan Friendly (War Deck / 1v1 Friendly for all archetypes).
3. **Practice with clan mates even after your battle**. You should be helping players who haven’t played their war match by practicing with them even if you already played your war match.
4. **Read war analysis + approved decks**. For every war, there will be a war analysis posted on discord with approved decks . You need to read this one before you play your match since you might want to use one of these decks. Let us know you read this analysis by adding the ✅  as a reaction. (We do take Discord activity in consideration when we need a free spot in our clan.)
5. **Deck approvals**. If you decide you are not able or capable of playing one of the approved decks which will be posted on discord. You absolutely can create your own deck. BUT, before going in, ask for approval by the leadership or deck approvers which are capable of judging your deck. If you decide to go in without any approval, you might risk a kick.
    - You can tag a `@BravoDeckApprover` on Discord and show them what you wish to play by either posting a deck link which the bot will translate into an image automatically, or post a screenshot. Deck approvers will be able to tailor your deck to your card levels.
6. **Fun**. Maybe the most important rule — have fun!

If you have any questions, please contact a member of the leadership.

Give this the pinned post a ✅ after you have read it.
