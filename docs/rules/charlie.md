## Elders

When accepting people they need to have 12 challenge wins. If they do not meet 50% cards in gold or higher readiness, cjp will have to kick as this is our new accepting policy.

ALSO, when you accept someone you need to tell them discord is required and `@CharlieLead`  telling us who you accepted here so we can watch for them on discord and so we can check their card readiness on royale api to see if they meet 50%. If you accept someone and fail to ping us here you WILL be demoted. This is your first and last warning. I need to get us to legendary and to do this I need your help and cooperation, Thank you.

### General

As you have probably noticed our focus now is more about war than ladder. On a practical level this means we are no longer kicking the 50th placed player on ladder. Instead we will kick players based on a number of factors primarily war performance and activity.

As we move up in war tiers card levels are going to become a factor too. Some of you may hit a ceiling where you can't compete without higher level cards. Kicked players can move down to lower clans like they always have.  You will have the opportunity to improve your war rankings and move back up.

### Clan Wars

We are also implementing some new war rules:

1. No attacks within the first 30 minutes of a war starting. (If this is an absolute problem in a given war speak to leadership)
2. Use of approved decks is strongly encouraged. These are posted in charlie discord. Leadership will also try to post them in game. If you can't use an approved deck please get feedback from clan members before you go in.
3. You must practice your deck (approved or otherwise) at least 3 times in a challenge or friendlies before going in.
4. Share your war day replay after your match finishes. Anyone commenting on a replay - please keep it constructive and positive.

Also, any Elders accepting new members need to tell them to get on discord and read the pinned war rules in `#charlie`. Be wary of accepting players with poor war day records.

Failure to do any of these can get you kicked. We will be lenient for a little while, but we want everyone on board with this. If you do want a more casual CR experience please consider one of the lower clans or Zen. Ultimately we want to improve and climb as a clan and we believe these rules will help us do that.
