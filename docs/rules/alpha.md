# Alpha

## Clan Wars

1. Minimum 3 practices with the deck (including CC / GC games)
2. Mecks approved by deck approvers (ApocD21, Predator, Nova | Mystic, Meridian, 6Dad for now.)
    - meaning, whatever deck you want to use, you must share in clan and one of the above needs to say 'ok you can use it', you can also `@Alpha Deck Approvers` to tag us all on Discord
    - pre-approved decks do not need additional approval, meaning if Apoc went in with miner barrel and won, anyone else can use it without further approval (exact replicas only)

!> Failure to comply with any of the above rules will result in a swift kick
